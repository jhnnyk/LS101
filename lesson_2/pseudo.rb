# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

# get first number
# get second number
# add the two numbers
# print out the result

# START

#   GET number1
#   GET number2

#   result = number1 + number2

#   PRINT result

# END

# ----------------

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, 
#    and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# Given an array of strings
# Iterate through the collection one by one.
#   - save the first value as the starting value
#   - for each iteration, add the new string to the starting string
# After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.

# START

#   Given a collection of strings called "strings"

#   SET iterator = 0

#   WHILE iterator < length of "strings"
#     big_string << string value at iterator
#     iterator += 1

#   PRINT big_string

# END

# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, 
#    and returns a new array with every other element

# Given an array of integers
# Iterate through the collection one by one.
#   - add the first value to a new array
#   - skip the next value
#   - repeat for the entire array
# Return the new array

# START 

#   Given an array called "numbers"

#   SET iterator = 0

#   WHILE iterator < length of numbers
#     IF iterator%2 = 0
#       add number to new_array
#       iterator += 1

#   PRINT new_array
